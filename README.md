# Basic-C2
Very simple and basic C2, server written in python (has a builder) and client in c++ with only one command which is greet each connection returns the same message which is "Hello Fella"

```
i do NOT recommend if someone reverse engineers the fucking exe they will find your local ip i hard codded the server address because im a fucking retard
```

```
so im trying to get into malware development and other stuff so im trying to get better with c++
so this is like one of my first c++ projects kinda because most of the code was written in python like the builder the ui and the server
```

# How to use
```
1. have python installed (pretty sure all libs used are built in)
2. open server.py
3. so now im assuming you are not a retard and you know what a server address and a port is
4. build
5. start listening
6. open/send exe to yourself or anyone
7. run the ./greet command in commands! (all connections send the same fucking message)
```
